# cursor_log.txt Append-Only Protocol (MUST)

## When updating `cursor_log.txt`

- Only **append** at the **true end of file (EOF)**. Never insert near the top or in the middle.
- Before editing, read the **last ~100 lines** to confirm the current ending.
- Append using this exact structure:

```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

<user prompt>

<assistant output summary>


============================================================
```

## Verification (required)

- Re-read the last ~40 lines after editing and confirm the new entry is the final entry (EOF).
