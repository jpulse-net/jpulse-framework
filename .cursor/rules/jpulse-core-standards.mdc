# jPulse Framework - Core Assistant Rules

- Do not run any `git` commands unless the user explicitly approves first.
- Do not guess or hallucinate. If context is missing, use the transcript file the user provided, or say “I don’t know” / “I am not sure, but I can look it up if you’d like”.
- Follow source formatting preferences:
    - No tabs in source; use spaces only.
    - Prefer 4 spaces for indentation.
    - No spaces on empty lines (avoid lines matching `^ +$`).

# Session Hygiene

- If the user provides a transcript path, consult it for missing details instead of guessing.
