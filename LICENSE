Section 11: USAGE REPORTING (BSL Period Only)

11.1 Compliance Reporting Requirement
     While this Licensed Work is governed by the Business Source License 1.1
     (i.e., prior to the Change Date of 2030-01-01), production deployments
     must send automated daily usage reports to jpulse.net containing deployment
     metrics as documented at https://jpulse.net/docs/license

11.2 Scope of Reporting
     Reports include: deployment UUID, version information, aggregate user counts,
     server/instance counts, and activity metrics. Reports do not include user
     content, personal information (except opt-in admin email for monitoring
     service), or sensitive data beyond what is necessary for license compliance
     verification.

11.3 Post-Conversion Period
     Effective on the Change Date (2030-01-01), when this License converts to
     GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, the compliance reporting requirement

     governed solely by AGPL-3.0 without additional restrictions.

11.4 Air-Gapped and Restricted Environments
     For deployments in air-gapped, network-restricted, or highly-secure
