# Markdown Publishing Configuration
#
# This file controls how your markdown documentation is published and displayed.
# Place this file (.markdown) in your docs root directory (e.g., docs/.markdown).
#
# Three optional sections:
#   [publish-list]   - Control the order of important docs and set custom titles
#   [ignore]         - Exclude files/directories from publishing
#   [title-case-fix] - Fix auto-generated titles (e.g., "Api" → "API")
#
# All sections are optional. If this file doesn't exist, all .md files are
# published in alphabetical order with auto-generated titles.
#
# See full documentation: https://jpulse.net/jpulse-docs/markdown-docs

#____________________________________________________________________________
[publish-list]

# Define the order of your most important documentation pages.
# Files listed here appear first in the sidebar, in the order you specify.
# All other .md files are published alphabetically after these.
#
# Format: filepath <optional-title>
#   - filepath: relative to your docs/ directory (e.g., "getting-started.md")
#   - optional-title: custom title (if omitted, auto-generated from filename)
#   - Use spaces or tabs to separate filepath from title
#
# Examples:
#   README.md           Welcome to My Docs
#   getting-started.md  Getting Started
#   api-reference.md                    (title auto-generated: "API Reference")
#   guides/tutorial.md  Tutorial Guide  (subdirectory file)
#
# Tips:
#   - List only your most important pages here for custom ordering
#   - Use comments (lines starting with #) to organize sections
#   - Subdirectories: list each file explicitly (e.g., "guides/README.md")

#____________________________________________________________________________
[ignore]

# Exclude files and directories from publishing.
# Only affects files NOT listed in [publish-list] above.
# Files in [publish-list] are always published, even if they match ignore patterns.
#
# Syntax: gitignore-like patterns (relative to docs/ directory)
#   - "file.md"          - ignore specific file
#   - "draft-*.md"       - ignore files matching pattern
#   - "dev/"             - ignore entire directory (trailing /)
#   - "*"                - whitelist mode: only publish files in [publish-list]
#
# Examples:
#   draft-feature.md     - exclude draft file
#   *.backup.md          - exclude all backup files
#   internal/            - exclude internal directory
#   dev/working/         - exclude working directory
#
# Common use cases:
#   - Hide draft or work-in-progress documents
#   - Exclude development/internal documentation
#   - Create a whitelist (use "*" to only publish [publish-list] files)

# Ignore roadmap and working directory
dev/roadmap.md
dev/working/

#____________________________________________________________________________
[title-case-fix]

# Fix auto-generated titles when converting filenames to page titles.
# Only applies to titles that are auto-generated (not custom titles in [publish-list]).
#
# Format: from-word    to-word
#   - from-word: word as it appears in auto-generated title
#   - to-word:   corrected version
#   - Use spaces or tabs to separate
#
# Examples:
#   Api             API
#   CHANGELOG       Version History
#   Css             CSS
#   Javascript      JavaScript
#
# Common fixes:
#   - Acronyms: "Api" → "API", "Css" → "CSS"
#   - Special terms: "CHANGELOG" → "Version History"
#   - Product names: "Jpulse" → "jPulse"
#
# Note: Framework provides default fixes (API, CSS, etc.). Your entries here
# extend or override those defaults.
