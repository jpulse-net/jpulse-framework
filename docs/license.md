# jPulse Framework / Docs / License, jPulse v1.0.0

## Overview

jPulse Framework is licensed under **Business Source License 1.1 (BSL 1.1)**, a source-available license that provides full source code access while requiring a commercial license for production use.

**Key Points:**
- ✅ **Free for**: Evaluation, development, testing, and learning
- ✅ **Source Code**: Fully accessible and publicly available
- ❌ **Production Use**: Requires commercial license
- 🔄 **Future**: Automatically converts to AGPL v3.0 on **Change Date: 2030-01-01**

## What is Business Source License 1.1?

Business Source License 1.1 is a source-available license that:

- Makes source code publicly accessible for viewing, learning, and development
- Allows free use for non-production purposes (evaluation, testing, development)
- Requires a commercial license for production deployments and commercial use
- Automatically converts to an open source license (AGPL v3.0) after a specified Change Date

This approach balances:
- **Source Transparency**: Full code access builds developer trust and enables learning
- **Commercial Protection**: Production use requires licensing, preventing exploitation
- **Future Flexibility**: Automatic conversion to AGPL enables eventual open source benefits

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is jPulse open source?**
A: jPulse uses Business Source License 1.1, which is source-available (not OSI-approved open source). The source code is fully accessible, but production use requires a commercial license until the Change Date (2030-01-01), when it converts to AGPL v3.0 (full open source).

**Q: Can I use jPulse for free?**
A: Yes, for evaluation, development, testing, and learning. Production use requires a commercial license.

**Q: What is "production use"?**
A: Production use means any deployment that serves end users, customers, or clients, or handles real business operations. This includes internal tools used by employees in production.

**Q: Can I contribute to jPulse?**
A: Yes! Contributions are welcome. By contributing, you grant the licensor the right to use your contributions under BSL 1.1 and future licenses (including AGPL v3.0).

**Q: Do I need a license for development/staging?**
A: No, development and staging environments are free under BSL 1.1.

### Licensing Questions

**Q: What happens on the Change Date (2030-01-01)?**
A: jPulse automatically converts to AGPL v3.0, a full open source license. Commercial licensing will remain available for enterprises requiring proprietary use.

**Q: Can I use jPulse in my SaaS product?**
A: SaaS products require a commercial license. Contact [team@jpulse.net](mailto:team@jpulse.net) for licensing options.

**Q: What if I'm building an open source application?**
A: Currently, you need a commercial license for production deployment, even for open source applications. After the Change Date (2030), AGPL v3.0 will allow open source production use with source disclosure requirements.

**Q: Can government agencies use jPulse?**
A: Yes, government agencies can evaluate and develop with jPulse free of charge. Production deployments require a commercial license, which is ideal for agencies that cannot disclose source code due to security or classification requirements.

**Q: What about educational institutions?**
A: Educational use for teaching, research, and learning is free. Production deployments by educational institutions (e.g., student information systems) require a commercial license.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Can I modify jPulse source code?**
A: Yes, for development and testing purposes. Modified versions for production use still require a commercial license.

**Q: Can I redistribute jPulse?**
A: Yes, you can redistribute verbatim copies for evaluation and development purposes. Production redistribution requires a commercial license.

**Q: Are there license compatibility issues?**
A: BSL 1.1 is source-available and not OSI-approved. Dependencies using permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0) are compatible. After conversion to AGPL v3.0, standard AGPL compatibility rules apply.

**Q: Can I use jPulse with other open source software?**
A: Yes, for development and testing. For production use with other open source software, consult your commercial license agreement.
