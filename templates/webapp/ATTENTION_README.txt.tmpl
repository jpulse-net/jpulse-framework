⚠️  IMPORTANT: DO NOT MODIFY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ⚠️

This webapp/ directory contains jPulse Framework files that are automatically
managed and updated. Any changes you make here will be lost during framework updates.

🎯 FOR SITE CUSTOMIZATION:
- Use the site/ directory for all your customizations
- Create site/webapp/app.conf for configuration overrides  
- Add site controllers, models, and views as needed
- Place site-specific static files in site/webapp/static/

📚 DOCUMENTATION:
- Site customization guide: https://%JPULSE_DOMAIN_NAME%/jpulse/site-customization
- Template reference: https://%JPULSE_DOMAIN_NAME%/jpulse/template-reference
- Getting started: https://%JPULSE_DOMAIN_NAME%/jpulse/getting-started

💡 Remember: The jPulse Framework follows the "site override" pattern.
   Framework files provide defaults, site files provide customizations.
